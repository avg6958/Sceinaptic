1. Read File
if file is .csv then use readCsv() 
else if file is .csv then use readExcel()

2. iterating over columns,
 if '.' is found in column names/schema , then replace it '_' 
 a.
	i. creating DF for every column with only non-null values
	    a. counting total records per column
	    b. counting distinct records per column
	ii. creating DF for every column with only null values
		a. counting null values per column
	
 b. setting a threshold, to determine the category of each column in dataSet. Threshold will depend on the data size though.
	i. if the distinct count of values in a column is <= threshold, then its a categorical or discrete type.
		a. count distinct values.
	ii. else, it is of either continuous or text type.
		a. if date, then parse it as date and compute MAX, MIN and bins with frequency(Histogram)
		b. if not date but Int, then parse as Int and compute MAX, MIN and bins with frequency(Histogram)
		c. if not Int but Float, then parse as Float and compute MAX, MIN and bins with frequency(Histogram)
		d. else, it is text column. find word count for text column.

 c. a short code to empty the output directory at the time of loading new file

 d. Store the structured output into a text file.
